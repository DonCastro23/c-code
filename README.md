Rock Paper Scissors

Project Description:
Developed a fully interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game in C featuring a console-based interface, input validation, and a randomized computer opponent. The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including control structures, user input handling, function modularity, and use of the C standard library.
